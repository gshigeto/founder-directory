# Self Evaluation

## What I did well
* All of the views display and look really nice
* All of the actions work as expected
* My code is consistent across all controllers
* Learned concepts in Swift that I did not previously know

## What I did not do so well
* I didn't get the images to save
* Time it takes to load pages are rather long?
* Small view details
